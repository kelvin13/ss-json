// cannot build the documentation plugin on these platforms due to 
// https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server/issues/1299#issuecomment-1089950219
// cannot build the documentation plugin on windows since apparently 
// the PackagePlugin module is not available

// because the 5.6 compiler can recognize snippets, but not ignore them (?!), 
// invoking the plugin on 5.6 will always fail, because the SPM does not know 
// how to exclude targets it does not know how to serialize.
// the snippets directory path is hard-coded in the compiler, and since we 
// donâ€™t have another way to conditionally exclude snippets from compilation, 
// there is no way to work around this other than only enabling the plugin on 
// nightly toolchains.
